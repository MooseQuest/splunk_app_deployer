# Splunk App Deployer - Python Dependencies
#
# This project is designed to use ONLY the Python standard library
# to ensure maximum compatibility and minimal installation requirements.
#
# No external dependencies are required!
#
# Python version requirement: 3.6+
#
# The following standard library modules are used:
# - os, sys, platform (system interaction)
# - pathlib (cross-platform path handling)
# - subprocess (external command execution)
# - tarfile (backup compression)
# - configparser (app.conf file handling)
# - argparse (command-line argument parsing)
# - datetime (timestamp generation)
# - re (regular expressions)
# - shutil (file operations)
# - typing (type hints)
#
# If you want to run optional development tools:
# flake8>=3.8.0  # Code linting (optional)
# mypy>=0.910    # Type checking (optional)
#
# But these are NOT required for normal operation!
